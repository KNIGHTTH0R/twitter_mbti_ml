Synopsis

This twitter analytics was a self-initiated side project from me to use natural language processing to predict Myers-Briggs Type IndicatorÂ® (MBTI) personality types based on tweets and social media posts.

User types in a text message (no length restriction) and the code returns 1 of 4 pages (categories) showcasing which MBTI profile the person is and the corresponding sales pitch most effective for that person.

Code Example

I found this from a twitter post:

"Think philanthropy is only for the 1%? @MasamiSato & @pauldunn show that anyone can make a huge impact on the world by starting small."

The algorithm will return the "Analyst" profile, which corresponds to INTJ, INTP, ENTP & ENTJ from the MBTI methodology.

Motivation

My goal was to help salespeople and entrepreneurs who have awesome products but face difficulty selling with standardized pitches. Many of them don't know that customized pitches are far more effective.

After learning various prediction algorithms and text analytics, I decided to build a tool that can serve as a good starting point for salespeople to understand their leads so they are better able to communicate their value to the client, and hopefully close more sales.

Contributors

Pang Sheng Wei was my accountability buddy throughout the project, we shared machine learning resources, school notes, prediction model and web development codes.

You can check out his repository (https://github.com/LifeArchitect/ml_mbti) for more codes on the project.

Check out http://personality-central.com.sg/ to learn more about MBTI in sales. Ethan (Founder) gave us lots of practical advice and guidance on how to utilise our prediction tool for sales. We are working with him to roll it out for his students.

Thanks!
